# Project Rules

- Be brief and concise in all responses
- Use minimal code to accomplish any goal
- When debugging, verify and test assumptions before making major code changes
- No README files
- Prefer SwiftUI + SwiftData with CloudKit for iCloud sync
- Target macOS 15+ and iOS 18+ (Tahoe-era design)
