# Project Rules

- Be brief and concise in all responses
- Use minimal code to accomplish any goal
- When debugging, verify and test assumptions before making major code changes
- No README files
- Prefer SwiftUI with iCloud Drive file sync for cross-device sync
- Target macOS 15+ and iOS 18+ (Tahoe-era design)
- Do not run shell commands automatically - provide commands for user to run
